# Pyber Analysis Overview
## Initial Results
We first looked at the average fare as compared to the number of rides sold by city type. We broke them down based on Rural, Suburban or Urban type. Seeing that the average fare was much higher despite there being far fewer trips and drivers prompted a closer look at the data.

## A Closer Look
* Loooking closely at the Ride Count Data we can see nearly 4x the ridership in Urban areas
  ** This is likely a result of fewer car owners
  **Shorter and less expensive trips
  **A younger gig economy demographic

•	The average fare, based on city type shows us that Rural areas capture nearly 1.5x of the Urban average
o	This is a possible result of greater distance between locations
o	Higher rates due to fewer drivers
o	Overall lower population density

•	In this figure we can see a that there are more than 7x the available drivers in urban areas
o	This is a likely result of supply growing to meet the demand in Urban areas

Looking at figures 5,6,7 we can see that less than 3% of our drivers are in rural areas, however they are capturing 5% of the rides, as opposed to 80% of the drivers capturing less than 70% in Urban areas

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
•	There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
