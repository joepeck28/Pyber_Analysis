# Pyber Analysis Overview
## Initial Results
We first looked at the average fare as compared to the number of rides sold by city type. We broke them down based on Rural, Suburban or Urban type. Seeing that the average Rural fare was much higher despite far fewer trips and drivers prompted a closer look at the data.

## A Closer Look
- Loooking closely at the Ride Count Data we can see nearly 4x the ridership in Urban areas
  * This is likely a result of fewer car owners
  * Shorter and less expensive trips
  * A younger, gig economy, demographic

- The average fare, based on city type shows us that Rural areas capture nearly 1.5x of the Urban average
  * This is a possible result of greater distance between locations
  * Higher rates due to fewer drivers
  * Overall lower population density

- In this figure we can see a that there are more than 7x the available drivers in urban areas
  * This is a likely result of supply growing to meet the demand in Urban areas

Looking at the figures below we can see that less than 3% of our drivers are in rural areas, however they are capturing nearly 7% of the fares, as opposed to 80% of the drivers capturing close to 60% of the fares in Urban areas

Based on the results, I have three recommendations to improve the overall service to our clients and profitablilty for PyBer
 1. Lower the rates in Rural areas to increase ridership, longer trips means higher prices. 
 2. Recruit more rural drivers, with an increase in ridership we will need more drivers to meet the demand.
 3. Raise the rates in Urban areas to more closely align the fare capture with the number of drivers.
